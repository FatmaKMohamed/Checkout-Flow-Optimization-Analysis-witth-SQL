# Checkout-Flow-Optimization-Analysis-witth-SQL
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the checkout process of the 365 platform by investigating user behaviors and uncovering potential bottlenecks in the checkout flow. Using SQL, the analysis extracts key insights into user interactions, checkout success, cart abandonment rates, and error patterns, helping improve the payment experience.

## Project Overview
The primary goal is to enhance the checkout flow by analyzing user data from July 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023. Key metrics include:

- Monthly Checkout Success Rate: Percentage of successful checkouts compared to total checkout attempts.
- Monthly Cart Abandonment Rate: Percentage of users who added items to their cart but didnâ€™t complete the purchase.
- Checkout Errors and Device Correlations: Identification of common errors and their association with device types to suggest technical improvements.

## SQL Implementation
- Extracted data for daily checkout activities, including total carts created, checkout attempts, and successful checkouts.
- Calculated metrics for monthly checkout success rates and cart abandonment rates.
- Identified common error messages encountered during failed checkout attempts.
- Analyzed correlations between error occurrences and device types used during checkout.
